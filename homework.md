Polymorphism & Composition Homework - Quiz


Polymorphism:

1.  What does the word 'polymorphism' mean?

Polymorphism is when something can take many different forms.  

2.  What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example.

Polymorphism can make Object Oriented programs more dry and scaleable.  We can use abstract classes or interfaces for this.  An java example would be the one we did where a Desktop could be both a desktop and an IConnect.

3.  What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?

Abstract class or interface.

4.  How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?

Unlimited?

5.  Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.

The example above where a Desktop could be both a desktop and an Iconnect.  A car can be a vehicle, it is also a car, etc.

Composition

6.  What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?

What objects is a class composed of?  A car class may have an engine object, but so may a motorbike or bus.  If we have an engine or gearbox class then each of the vehicles classes can use it.

7.  When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.

Above.

8.  What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition?

More dry and scaleable.

9.  When an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?

Also destroyed.
